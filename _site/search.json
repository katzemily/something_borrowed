    "text": "Something Borrowed was founded by two friends, Gwen & Emily. They first met attending the same college, but didn’t become close friends until they studied abroad for a semester in Prague as part of the same program. These days, Emily lives in Portland, and Gwen lives in Seattle, but they share a strong interest in sustainability and community-building and love having a project to work on together."

    "text": "Welcome!\nSomething Borrowed is a free, community-based wedding item exchange that strives to reduce both waste and costs for individuals planning weddings, while also building stronger communities.\nFind a Something Borrowed community in your city to give away or ask for items related to weddings and wedding planning!\n\n\nCurrent Locations\n\nPortland, Oregon\nSeattle, Washington\n\n\nJoin our Slack\n\n Already a member?\n\nGo to Slack\n\n\n\nCommunity Guidelines\n\nNothing can be purchased, sold, or traded. Instead offer, ask, or borrow.\nBe honest (about the condition of your goods, who you are, etc.).\nOnly offer items that are legal. If an item is age restricted (e.g., alcohol), please do not offer it.\n\nMake sure you’re using the correct channel. We will remove your post if you use the incorrect channel.\n\nAll item exchanges should be in a city-specific channel (e.g., #wa-seattle-exchange)\n\nAll introductions should be in the #introductions channel\n\nAll advice or recommendations should be in the #advice channel\n\nAsk the moderators for help in #ask-moderator\n\n\nBe gender inclusive (don’t assume people are marrying someone of the opposite sex; don’t assume only brides are in this community; use the pronouns people list in their profile).\nYou can join more than one channel if you’re willing to drive further, but you must post any offers in the channel closest to where you live.\nSelf-promotion and advertising is not allowed. Please use this for your individual needs, not your business needs.\nHarassment and discrimination will not be tolerated.\nIf a moderator suspects you have acted outside of the community guidelines, you will either receive a warning or be removed depending on severity.\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nThere isn’t currently a Something Borrowed Community where I live. When will you be expanding to my city?\nWe would love to expand Something Borrowed to more locations. Please fill out the interest form below and let us know where we should go next!\n\nInterest Form\n\n\n\n\nI’m a wedding vendor/professional - is it okay for me to join?\nYes, absolutely! Our only ask of wedding professionals is that you don’t ask for items that you later intend to sell or rent. If you are getting an item that you can use in your business or use for a client’s wedding, that’s allowed, but we hope you will consider offering up items any time you’re done using them or have an excess of items left over after a wedding.\n\n\nI have items to give that might be useful for a wedding, but I’m not married/recently married - is it okay for me to join?\nYes, absolutely! Anyone with items to gift that might be useful for a wedding is welcome to join. This can mean a wide range of items, but some examples might include: decor, DIY/crafting materials, bar or catering related items, floral supplies, etc.\n\n\nI’m having trouble joining the Slack. Who can I contact for help?\nPlease go to our About page and click the “Email Us” button. Use the subject line “Something Borrowed Help” in your email."
