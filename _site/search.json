    "text": "Something Borrowed was founded by two friends, Gwen & Emily. They first met attending the same college, but didn’t become close friends until they studied abroad for a semester in Prague as part of the same program. These days, Emily lives in Portland, and Gwen lives in Seattle, but they share a strong interest in sustainability and community-building and love having a project to work on together."
