    "text": "Something Borrowed was founded by two friends, Gwen & Emily. They first met attending the same college, but didn’t become close friends until they studied abroad for a semester in Prague as part of the same program. These days, Emily lives in Portland, and Gwen lives in Seattle, but they share a strong interest in sustainability and community-building and love having a project to work on together."

Instead offer, ask, or borrow.\nBe honest (about the condition of your goods, who you are, etc.).\nOnly offer items that are legal. If an item is age restricted (e.g., alcohol), please do not offer it.\nBe gender inclusive (don’t assume people are marrying someone of the opposite sex; don’t assume only brides are in this community; use the pronouns people list in their profile).\nYou can join more than one channel if you’re willing to drive further, but you must post any offers in the channel closest to where you live.\nSelf-promotion and advertising is not allowed. Please use this for your individual needs, not your business needs.\nHarassment and discrimination will not be tolerated.\nIf a moderator suspects you have acted outside of the community guidelines, you will either receive a warning or be removed depending on severity.\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nThere isn’t currently a Something Borrowed Community where I live. Can I help start one?\nYes! We would love to expand Something Borrowed to more locations. Please join our slack and reach out to our Co-founders to talk about next steps.\n\n\nI’m having trouble joining the Slack. Who can I contact for help?\nPlease go to our About page and click the “Email Us” button. Use the subject line “Something Borrowed Help” in your email."
