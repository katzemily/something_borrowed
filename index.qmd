### Welcome!

Something Borrowed is a free, community-based wedding item exchange that strives to reduce both waste and costs for individuals planning weddings, while also building stronger communities.

Find a Something Borrowed community in your city to give away or ask for items related to weddings and wedding planning!

### Current Locations

-   Portland, Oregon

-   Seattle, Washington

### Community Guidelines  

-   Nothing can be purchased, sold, or traded. Instead offer, ask, or borrow.
-   Be honest (about the condition of your goods, who you are, etc.).
-   Only offer items that are legal. If an item is age restricted (e.g., alcohol), please do not offer it.
-   Be gender inclusive (don't assume people are marrying someone of the opposite sex; don't assume only brides are in this community; use the pronouns people list in their profile).
-   You can join more than one channel if you're willing to drive further, but you must post any offers in the channel closest to where you live.
-   Self-promotion and advertising is not allowed. Please use this for your individual needs, not your business needs. 
-   Harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated.
-   If a moderator suspects you have acted outside of the community guidelines, you will either receive a warning or be removed depending on severity.
